Run-time error in controlfile: CloudySky_1D_ARTSvdev.arts
Run-time error in method: scat_dataCalc
There is a problem with the grids for the following interpolation:
scat_data_raw.f_grid to f_grid
The minimum of the new grid must be inside the original grid.
(We allow a bit of extrapolation, but not so much).
Minimum of original grid:           2.29e+11
Minimum allowed value for new grid: 2.28e+11
Actual minimum of new grid:         2.2234e+10
Stopping ARTS execution.
Goodbye.
